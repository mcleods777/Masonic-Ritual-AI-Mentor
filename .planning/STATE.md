# State: Masonic Ritual AI Mentor — v1 Invited-Lodge Milestone

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23 (Phase 3 Plan 03 landed — dev-guard.ts extracted)

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** A Masonic officer can reliably rehearse their ritual parts — at any hour, with no other brother available — and come out of the session more confident that their memorization is accurate to their lodge's working.

**Current Focus:** Phase 03 — Authoring Throughput

**Project type:** Brownfield — the pilot already ships and is in daily use by Shannon.

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (Authoring Throughput) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 8 (Plans 01 + 02 + 03 complete; SUMMARIES at `.planning/phases/03-authoring-throughput/03-01-SUMMARY.md`, `03-02-SUMMARY.md`, `03-03-SUMMARY.md`)
**Milestone:** v1 invited-lodge
**Phase:** Phase 2 MERGED to main (PR #68 → merge commit `d2e02cc`, 2026-04-22)
**Plan:** Phase 2 9/9 complete; Phase 3 3/8 complete
**Status:** Executing Phase 03
**Progress:** [████████░░] 79%

```
[█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 29% (2/7 phases)
```

**Production URLs (both serving Phase 2 code):**

- https://masonicmentor.app (custom domain, TLS auto-provisioned)
- https://masonic-ritual-ai-mentor.vercel.app (Vercel alias, kept)

**LODGE_ALLOWLIST** (8 pilot addresses, production-live):
mcleods777@gmail.com, ajw71681@gmail.com (Amanda), wadeburger@rocketmail.com, bslashstewart@gmail.com, hagiller@gmail.com, flynmcgilvray93@gmail.com, hellostevenbecker@msn.com (note: msn deliverability caveat — may need gmail swap if reports inbox issues), justincopeland67@gmail.com

**Resend sending domain:** `masonicmentor.app` verified via Cloudflare DNS (DKIM+SPF+DMARC); `MAGIC_LINK_FROM_EMAIL=mentor@masonicmentor.app`.

**Next action:** Phase 3 Plan 03-04 (author-validation bake-band, D-08). Plan 03-03 landed on `gsd/phase-3-authoring-throughput` — `src/lib/dev-guard.ts` is now the single source of truth for dev-only refusal semantics (D-15). Exports `isDev()` (non-throwing, for UI) + `assertDevOnly()` (throws with `[DEV-GUARD]` prefix in production, for Node scripts). `/author/page.tsx` rewired to use `isDev()`; inline NODE_ENV check removed; banner JSX byte-identical. 422 tests passing (+8 dev-guard tests vs Plan 02 baseline), 0 regressions, build clean. Plans 03-04 through 03-08 can run; no blockers.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 7-phase structure honoring REQUIREMENTS.md categories | Categories already imply natural delivery boundaries; research suggested 5-phase but instructions directed category-driven | Roadmapping 2026-04-20 |
| Phase 3 (Authoring) before Phase 4 (Content) | Content work is Shannon-hours; bake cache + validators must exist before re-baking 5+ rituals is practical | Roadmapping 2026-04-20 |
| Phase 2 (Safety) before Phase 5 (Coach) | Coach phase iterates hard on feedback route; per-user caps must exist first | Research ARCHITECTURE.md + roadmapping |
| AUTHOR-10 (idb-schema extract) in Phase 3 | Phase 5 COACH-06 feedbackTraces store needs the schema module first; treated as a Phase 3 prerequisite for Phase 5 | Roadmapping 2026-04-20 |
| COACH-11 (RehearsalMode split) treated as prereq, not polish | PITFALLS + research both flag the 1,511-line monolith as a regression risk for any feedback-route work | Roadmapping 2026-04-20 |
| `mentor-v1` is the default variant; `roast-v1` is hidden A/B-only | Research convergence: roast persona appears to BE the quality gap | Research SUMMARY.md |
| Defer Upstash/Redis migration | Pilot scale (≤10 lodges) doesn't justify; in-memory with documented swap path | Research STACK.md |
| Reject third-party LLM body-observability for v1 | Langfuse/Helicone/LangSmith ingest full prompt+completion — even 1-2 expected ritual words violates the client-only data plane invariant | Research ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Phase 3 gitignore uses glob form `rituals/_bake-cache/*` + `!rituals/_bake-cache/.gitignore` | Plain directory form would ignore the nested self-documenting .gitignore the same decision D-01 asks to track; glob form satisfies both layers of the belt-and-suspenders pattern | Plan 03-01 execution |
| Phase 3 vitest.config.ts include glob extended to `scripts/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` | Plans 05-08 put their test scaffolds under `scripts/__tests__/`; without this entry, vitest silently filters them out even when passed as explicit file args | Plan 03-01 execution |
| `voice-storage.ts` re-exports `AUDIO_CACHE_STORE` after migration to `idb-schema.ts` | `src/lib/tts-cloud.ts:1036-1040` imports `AUDIO_CACHE_STORE` from voice-storage pre-D-16; preserving the re-export avoids a grep-and-replace across the codebase while D-16 still eliminates the inline constant. | Plan 03-02 execution |
| Plan 02 test case 3 (consumer parity) simplified to repeated-openDB() | Post-Task-2 both `storage.ts` and `voice-storage.ts` call the same `openDB()` — a storage-first-then-voice-first dance would be tautological. Repeated-open still proves the idempotent-upgrade invariant. | Plan 03-02 execution |
| Plan 03-03 used `@/lib/dev-guard` alias import in `/author/page.tsx` | Matches existing `@/lib/dialogue-to-mram` + `@/lib/mram-format` imports at lines 29-30; alias resolves cleanly in Next.js build; no fallback to relative path needed. | Plan 03-03 execution |
| dev-guard.ts: two-flavor API (`isDev` non-throwing for UI, `assertDevOnly` throwing for scripts) | Call-site ergonomics differ: React components render a graceful banner (need boolean); Node scripts should fail-fast at module load (need throw). Reading `process.env.NODE_ENV` at call time (not import time) lets tests mutate env between cases. | Plan 03-03 execution |

### Open Questions / Todos

- Confirm Shannon-specific authoring bottleneck ordering inside Phase 3 during plan phase (line-level regen vs batch orchestrator vs preview-bake)
- Freeze the gold-eval rubric ("stake my name on it" / "meh" / "wrong" + qualitative axes) as Phase 5 Task 1 artifact before any variant tuning
- Decide whether Haiku 4.5 earns a production variant slot (assume "maybe" until Phase 5 eval measures it)
- Revisit "does strong revocation need to ship earlier" based on the specific outside lodges in Shannon's invite queue (currently placed in Phase 6)

### Blockers

None.

## Session Continuity

**Last significant action:** Phase 3 Plan 03 (dev-guard extraction, AUTHOR-08 / D-15) executed on 2026-04-23. Two commits on `gsd/phase-3-authoring-throughput`: `4eda2b4` created `src/lib/dev-guard.ts` (33 lines, exports `isDev()` non-throwing + `assertDevOnly()` throwing with `[DEV-GUARD]` prefix) and filled the Wave 0 `dev-guard.test.ts` scaffold with 8 passing tests (4 `isDev()` + 4 `assertDevOnly()` covering dev/test/prod/unset NODE_ENV); `a61a47d` rewired `src/app/author/page.tsx` to import `isDev` from `@/lib/dev-guard` and changed `if (isProduction)` → `if (!isDev())`, removing the inline `const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"` line. Banner JSX preserved byte-for-byte (className, whitespace, text verbatim). Plan 08 (preview-bake.ts) now has a ready-to-import `assertDevOnly()`. Full suite: 422 passing + 54 todo; build clean; zero regressions. Zero deviations — plan executed exactly as written.

**Resumption cue:** Next action: Plan 03-04 (author-validation bake-band, D-08). Wave 0 scaffolding is already in place from Plan 01. No blockers.

**Critical context for next agent:**

1. Brownfield milestone — do NOT re-build existing pilot capability (see PROJECT.md Validated)
2. Phase 2 (Safety Floor) introduces paid-route rate limiting, audit log, budget caps, emergency kill switch. Dependency: Phase 2 benefits from HYGIENE-02's AI SDK v6 bump (commit 005dc82) but does not require rewriting `/api/rehearsal-feedback` — that's Phase 5 COACH-02.
3. Pending Phase 1 manual verification (both in `01-HUMAN-UAT.md`):
   - HYGIENE-05: Shannon iPhone + iCloud Private Relay magic-link test (~2-3 min)
   - HYGIENE-07: Rotation runbook rehearsal on Vercel preview (~15-30 min)
4. Phase 1 left on branch `gsd/phase-1-pre-invite-hygiene` — decide merge-to-main strategy before Phase 2 OR create a fresh `gsd/phase-2-safety-floor` branch from main (Phase 1 commits travel via merge).
5. Research findings from Phase 1 worth carrying forward: (a) codebase had zero AI SDK imports at Phase 1 start — Phase 5 COACH-02 will be the first consumer of v6 idioms; (b) current matcher is case-sensitive on .mram extension; (c) rotation runbook uses `vercel env update` atomically except for preview-branch (CLI v51.x limitation).
